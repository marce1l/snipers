# snipers

A telegram bot written in rust making ERC-20 token buying and selling simpler, safer and faster. Providing useful safety checks and other utilities all in one place.

## Bot functionality

- Buy and sell ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily (on-chain transactions not yet implemented)
- Check current ERC-20 tokens and ETH balances
- Monitor ETH wallets for new ERC-20 token transactions
- Check ETH gas fees and estimated uniswap transaction costs
- Scan ERC-20 tokens for potential red flags
- Snipe new tokens after they have passed basic safety checks (on-chain transactions not yet implemented, currently just sends a notification)

## Setting up your environment

To use this bot, you have to self host it.<br>
There are a few API keys you will need when setting up your environment, making sure the bot works.

> You can use every API listed here for free (credit card isn't required), if you don't go over their free tier (api requests will just fail)

### Environment variables

You can easily set environment variables by creating a .env file in the root of the project. You will need the following environment variables to run the application.

```
TELOXIDE_TOKEN

ETH_ADDRESS

ETHERSCAN_API
ALCHEMY_API
MORALIS_API
CHAINBASE_API
```

- For the **ETH_ADDRESS**, you should add your ethereum address.<br>
  Used for getting wallet balance, executing transactions
